        <h2 id="STUKOV">Project STUKOV</h2>
        <p>
            STUKOV is an smart tool, wich can be used for "drive" a RC car, it can seem weird, but it's work !
            <br>Inside, we can found some components, and any one have a specifical function. All of the 3d's plans used are availables with <a href="link_zip_fold" download>THIS LINK</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            This tool is an bionic arm, inside, we've got some components, wich are listed here :
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>an accelerometer, because the car is piloted with this component. It's used for drive, for go forward, you tilt STUKOV forward too, same for backward, left and righ direction.</li>
            <li>an Arduino card, it's the motherbord which serve at link every components between them</li>
            <li>a radio module, because I wouldn't had a linked car, and this module is compatible with the Arduino card</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            And it's all, I wasn't wanting to have a too fat arm, I was wanting the skinnyer as possible, I have reduce the number of components in this objectiv.<br>
            The fist problem when I was wanting to create this, it's the modelisation, because, we don't realized when we havn't try, but it's so hard ! 
            I swear, because, like you can see in the 3d plans, it's a lot of bended surfaces, and I havn't enought skills for did it whith iron or metals, 
            so I've done it with a 3d printer (thanks Wanahoo [unsponsored content] and my brother for the help). The harder isn't the modelisation, but the code, in fact,
            learn Arduino's code wasn't easy at the begening, because it's very different than others languages I've learned before, but it's one of my favorite part, I'm
            not an engineer, I'm a programer.

            Here, you can see the project IRL, I find the colors are realy cool, isn't ?<br><br>

            <br><br>
            At the beggining, it couldn't seem like this, it's more something like this : <br><br>
        </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>The first plan, the arm, with a shpere at the top, I would use it for do the link with the hand.</th>
                    <th>The famous hand, but without fingers, it's another plan. Nothing at say, except the hole at the center, it's somethng we can also see in the new plan.</th>
                    <th>One finger, every others was designed at the same way.</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><img src="arm" alt="The arm, described higher"></td>
                    <td><img src="palm" alt="palm of the hand"></td>
                    <td><img src="finger" alt="one finger"></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br><br>
        <p>
            It's not the same thing, but the first modele was too hard at realized, I was wanting "secret buttons" hidded by a modulable piece, wich was moved by a little motor
            (step by step)...a really annoying thing to do, and really hard to code, because the motor wasn't free and it added an other control to do,
            I don't really want to have something so intricate on arm, imagine how it's stressfull when it's hit or another thing, just for information, I've tooked it at
            the University, and we have a lot of stupid guys in the corridors, i wouldn't break it, it's my first realy big project, and I want it survive. For finish this project,
            I'll give you every codes wich are used in this project, in <a href="zip_code" download>this download link</a>

        <h2 id="PHOENIX">Project Phoenix</h2>
        <p>
            This project wasn't finished, so I can only show you the project on my computer, the 3d model, and the objectivs of this project. If I would be simple, Phoenix
            is a smart robot, wich is like a dog, but mechanical, why ? Because my brother and I are allergic at the dogs's hair, but i've always want one, so i've start by
            the design. If it seems like a dog, it's always better, but harder at do. The most difficult here wasn't the design, but the motor, and the captors, because if 
            it fall at every step, it wasn't a dog, it's a stupid robot. If you ask yourself "what is this ?", it's like a famous robot, developed by Boston Dynamics, called Spot<br><br>
            <img src="../images/P-E/spot.jpg" alt="Spot, the Boston Dynamic's robot"><br><br>
            It's really cool,
            it's my inspiration, because before, i didn't think it's possible to do, but now i know it's possible, so I really want to have it, but done by myself, and my bro,
            he made every project whith me, he is a really good electronician, he helps me with the Arduino's code by example. He is also a really good Youtuber (if you want <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@7D2">the link to his Youtube channel</a>)
            but, for this project, I won't do a dog, I want a spider...with 6 paws...everithing is okay. I've try to do a real spider, but I'm affraid of it !
            This time, I can't say "oh this part is sooo difficult", because Phoenix wasn't finished. I hope it can walk before may 2023, I keep you informed
